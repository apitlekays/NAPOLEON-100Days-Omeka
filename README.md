#NAPO-Theme-Development


Introduction
-------
Everyone has heard of Waterloo.
Less well-known is that Napoleon had already been defeated in 1814, but escaped his exile on Elba in February 1815,
swept across France gathering troops, and toppled the newly restored Bourbon monarchy in Paris without firing a shot.
Only then was he defeated by Wellington in June 1815, finally surrendering in July.
Day by day, this website releases an object that sheds light on these dramatic events,
along with weekly summaries sketching out the period as a whole. 

The Project
------
The project is using [Omeka](http://www.omeka.org) framework, a digital repository for historical objects, built by [Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu/). The idea is to display over 100 objects in a way that each day display one item from the database. Each item has its own historical significance and dated according to Napoleon's 100 days journey.

*This folder does not contains actual objects used in the final production. Generic assets will be used to replace the actual images and descriptions, and when the whole project is ported to the actual site, the editorial team will populate the site with appropriate contents*
